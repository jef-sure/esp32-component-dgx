# Changes

## Unreleased

- fixed the full-screen black fill fast path in `vscreen` (compared `y` with
  the height instead of `h`, so `memset` never ran)
- fixed `examples/screen_demo`: `dgx_ili9341_init()` call lacked the backlight
  argument added in 0.0.11; README no longer promises menuconfig pin options
- `DGX_ENABLE_MORPH` now selects `DGX_ENABLE_VSCREEN` (the renderers need it)
- component requirements: `esp_driver_gpio`, `esp_driver_spi`,
  `esp_driver_i2c` on IDF 5.3+, the legacy `driver` component before that
- `dgx_morph_create` returns NULL for sides above `INT16_MAX` cells;
  `dgx_morph_draw` skips dots whose pixel position does not fit `int16_t`
- added matrix helpers `dgx_matrix_clear`, `dgx_matrix_clone`,
  `dgx_matrix_copy`, `dgx_matrix_equals` and `dgx_matrix_from_bw_bitmap`
- added `dgx_morph_text_create` / `dgx_morph_text_destroy` /
  `dgx_morph_text_duration_us`: per-letter morph between two UTF-8 strings;
  `examples/morph_demo` uses it
- documented that `get_pixel` reads only virtual screens and panels with a
  virtual back screen
- marked the commented-out alternative ILI9341 init sequence as taken from
  TFT_eSPI and fixed its command labels
- added host tests (`make -C test/host`, ASan/UBSan)
- repaired the end of README (Known gaps, Repository layout)

## 0.1.1 - 2026-10-01

- corrected the glow falloff documentation to describe its squared-distance LUT
- enforce a minimum glow radius of 2 pixels so small cell sizes retain a soft dot

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-30

- `dgx_point_2d_t` fields are now `int16_t` (were `int`): halves point arrays
  (morph segments, glyph dots); code taking `int *` to `.x`/`.y` must adapt
- added font metrics `yBottomMax`, `xOffsetLowest` and `xRightMax` to
  `dgx_font_t` (bounding box of all glyphs); `font2c` emits them and all
  bundled fonts carry them
- added the dot morphing framework (`DGX_ENABLE_MORPH`): one bit-matrix to
  bit-matrix morph (`dgx_morph_create`) with pluggable source-selection
  callbacks (`dgx_morph_sources_life`, `dgx_morph_sources_cells`,
  `dgx_morph_ring_find`), glyph-to-matrix source, stateless per-frame
  `dgx_morph_draw` with head/tail trails, and glow / sprite renderers
  (optimized `collect_glow` core: dx-symmetric writes, incremental squared
  distance, preswapped grayscale LUT)
- added `examples/morph_demo`: CYD demo that morphs Russian words one letter
  at a time using independent per-letter morphs and glow renderers
- added `dgx_bw_bitmap_foreach_set()`: set-pixel scanner that skips whole zero
  bytes (8 pixels at once) for LINES-format bitmaps; used by glyph morphing

## 0.0.13 - 2026-06-22

- added sanity checks to utf-8 decoding

## 0.0.12 - 2026-06-19

- fixed backlight control to ILI9341 driver

## 0.0.11 - 2026-06-19

- added backlight control to ILI9341 driver

## 0.0.10 - 2026-06-15

- fixed MADCTL orientation command data length in ST7735, ST7789 and ILI9341 drivers

## 0.0.9 - 2026-06-14

- `font2c`: added `-f charset_file` (UTF-8 text input)

## 0.0.8 - 2026-06-14

- fixed OOB access in ILI9341/ST7789/ST7735/SSD1351 by embedding `dgx_screen_with_bus_t`
- thanks to **yuwgle** for pointing to the problem

## 0.0.7 - 2026-06-02

- added percent, celsius, dot, `R` and `H` to `CasusDotView` font

## 0.0.6 - 2026-06-01

- fixed `:` (colon) in `CasusDotView` font vertical alignment

## 0.0.5 - 2026-06-01

- added `:` (colon) to `CasusDotView` font

## 0.0.4 - 2026-05-30

- fix GPIO handling in SPI bus functions

## 0.0.3 - 2026-05-30

- added `dgx_gauge_redraw()` to redraw the whole gauge
- improved documentation

## 0.0.2 - 2026-05-13

- added `dgx_gc9a01_display_off()` and `dgx_gc9a01_display_on()` as public GC9A01 driver functions
